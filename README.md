# My-Websites
This repository contains a collection of my self-made responsive websites created while learning and practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is crafted with clean code, thoughtful design, and a focus on user experience. These websites showcase my growth as a web developer and serve as a portfolio of my frontend development skills.
